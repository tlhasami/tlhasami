## Software Engineering Student | Flutter Developer | UI/UX Enthusiast

I am a Software Engineering student focused on building real-world applications with clean architecture and strong fundamentals. I currently work with Flutter for mobile development and have a keen interest in UI/UX design and user-centered interfaces.

Alongside development, I consistently practice data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented programming to strengthen my problem-solving skills.
